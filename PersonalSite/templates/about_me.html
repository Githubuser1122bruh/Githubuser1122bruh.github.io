        <p>Hey! I’m Samhith Pola — a student, coder, trumpet-blower, and part-time lava magnet in Minecraft.</p>
        <p>I’m someone who enjoys a little bit of everything: music, tech, building things (digitally and sometimes physically), and just exploring new ideas. I play the trumpet in my school band, which means I get to make a lot of noise <em>and</em> call it productive — it’s a win-win. Music’s been a big part of my life for a while now, and it’s taught me a lot about rhythm, focus, and occasionally, how to hit the right note under pressure (or at least <em>try</em> to).</p>
        <p>Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into the world of coding. I’ve always been curious about how things work behind the screen, but what really kicked it into gear was discovering <strong>Hack Club</strong>. It’s this awesome community of teen hackers and builders who are all about learning by doing — which is exactly how I like to roll. Through Hack Club, I’ve met people from all over the world, picked up tons of new skills, and even got to work on a project called <strong>Juice</strong> while I was in Shanghai (yes, <em>the</em> Shanghai). It was a wild and amazing experience — if you're curious, check out the <em>Adventures</em> tab to hear more of that story.</p>
        <p>I’m currently getting into web development (surprise! you're looking at one of my first real sites). There's something really cool about turning a blank screen into something interactive and personal — kind of like digital magic, but with slightly more bugs.</p>
        <p>When I’m not coding or practicing trumpet, I’m usually playing Minecraft. Sometimes I’m building massive bases and redstone contraptions. Other times I’m... well, let’s just say “reconsidering my life choices after mining straight down.”</p>
        <p>Overall, I love learning, experimenting, and seeing where my curiosity takes me. Whether it’s a new coding project, a musical challenge, or a Minecraft mission, I’m all about trying things, making mistakes, and hopefully having a good laugh along the way.</p>
        <p>Thanks for dropping by! Feel free to explore the site — there’s more cool stuff waiting in the other tabs.</p>
